# TinfoilHatter
A single page async application that generates random, nonsense theories by calling wikimediaAPI to fill random titles from wikipedia categories into ×© pre-built template selected from an array. Several arrays of pre-selected key words are also available due to the surprising chaos that is wikipedia categories.
To those who wish to expand the categories enum, beware: those rabbit-holes are dark and full of terrors.
